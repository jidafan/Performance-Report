### 1. Introduction

The project shown is the customer analysis of shoppers from an online retail transaction data set of two years. The program uses KMeans Clustering to group customers and determine strategies for retaining and engaging customers. The data is from a UCI dataset that can be viewed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).

### 2. PowerBI

The code for the project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jidafan/Retail-Customer-Analysis/blob/main/Customers.ipynb)

#### 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

Before we begin working on the dataset, we must understand the data. In this step of the code, we create a data frame using Pandas to hold all the information from the Excel file.
